# About me and this project

Hi, I am Zehao. I created this project to demonstrate my interest and skill in programming when I am applying to
Northeastern GSG Senator ❤️.

And this is a time manager capable of managing tasks on your local browser. It is powered by React and 
syncing the data to a centralised server is still a work in progress, so please don't use it to store important information as you'll lose your data once you have cleared the website's cache.
