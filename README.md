# About me and this project
Hi, I am Zehao. I created this project to demonstrate my interest and skill in programming when I am applying to University of Pennsylvania's Master in Computer and Information Technology ❤️ and Northeastern University's Align Master in Computer science ❤️.

So before being admitted to any of the two programmes I would reserve all rights about my code. I'll opensource it after being admitted to any of them (or unfortunately being rejected by both of them) as my first contribution to the opensource community. 

And this is a time manager capable of managing tasks on your local browser. It is powered by React and 
syncing the data to a centralised server is still a work in progress, so please don't use it to store important information as you'll lose your data once you have cleared the website's cache.
