# About me and this project
Hi, I am Zehao. I created this project to demonstrate my interest and skill in programming when I am applying to University of Pennsylvania's Master in Computer and Information Technology ❤️ and Northeastern University's Align Master in Computer science ❤️.

Before being admitted to either of the two programmes, I would reserve all rights to my code. I'll opensource it after being admitted to one of them, or unfortunately, if I am rejected by both, as my first contribution to the opensource community. 

And this is a time manager capable of managing tasks on your local browser. It is powered by React and 
syncing the data to a centralised server is still a work in progress, so please don't use it to store important information as you'll lose your data once you have cleared the website's cache.

The url to the deployed application is included in my application documents. I choose not to publish the url in fear of attack to my little server and failed uni application due to server downtime.
